This repository contains the R code for the DataScience track's "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## Data Set

The data set "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" has been taken from [Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#)


## Files

The Data will be extracted in UCI HAR Dataset/ directory.

The CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and the work that has been performed to clean up the data.

The run_analysis.R is the script that has been used for this work. It can be loaded in R/Rstudio and executed without any parameters.
